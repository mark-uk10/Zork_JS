NOTE 1 ----- right now Iam happy with any words not in the commands list being classed as words it does not know and applying them as such.  Zork has levels of redundency for example 
    look at mailboxxxxxxxx or any random letters/string/or numbers
works fine
    look at mailbo
also works fine
    look at mailb
this does not work

This would be a nice furure development for this game to do.

NOTE 2 ---- Is there not a better way to do this ?

NOTE 3 ---- this will not work as a foreach look ??
